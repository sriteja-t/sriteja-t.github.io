I have been using different Android phones for a while and I encountered a problem with the backup and restore feature.

I started with a Redmi K20 Pro, which has a great hardware but runs on an older version of Android (10). I decided to switch to a Moto G31, which has a newer version of Android (12). I used the Google backup and restore feature to transfer my data from the K20 Pro to the G31. It worked fine and I got all my apps, call logs and SMS on the new phone.

However, after using the G31 for some time, I realized that I missed the performance and features of the K20 Pro. So I decided to switch back to it. I used the same Google backup and restore feature to transfer my data from the G31 to the K20 Pro. But this time, it didn't work properly. I only got some of my apps, but not my call logs and SMS. I was confused and frustrated. I thought it was a problem with MIUI, the custom Android skin that Redmi uses.

However... BBD sale arrived, I got new phone to replace the old redmi 4, whose screen had dead spots. I used the Google backup and restore feature again to transfer my data from the k20 pro to the new Samsung. But to my surprise, it didn't work at all. I didn't get any of my apps, call logs or SMS. I don't know what went wrong. Maybe Google changed something in their backup system or my backup totally disturbed by the MIUI.

Luckily, I still have my photos and files on Google Photos and Drive, so they are not affected. But I lost all my other data that was not that important to me. I don't know how to get it back or how to prevent this from happening again.

I searched the Google One website to see if I had a backup of my data, but I only found a g31 backup file with an incomplete warning. This means that the backup is not reliable and I cannot use it. 

and this is what I found. ![Alt text](gbackup.png)

Ping me, if anyone knows to use the incomplete backup file or any better solution.
